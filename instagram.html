            Instagram is probably never the right solution, even if your new friend uses it as a main source of contact.
            Try to use phone number instead. From our experience, we know that pretty much nothing about it is productive
            in our pursuit of Christ. It's a platform that either tempts us or gives us fake pleasure and discourages us
            from spending time with God in prayer, reading of scripture, fellowship, or ministry work instead.
