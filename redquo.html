            Keep in mind that reddit and quora doesn't have educational or productive content that aligns with our goal as followers of Christ.
            <br><br>It's best to avoid this platform and use other sources.
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>For entertainment, use the bible and delight in God's word.</li>
                <li>For ministry oriented coding, use platforms like stackoverflow or general documentation - or even just something like perplexity.</li>
                <li>For bible study, reddit and quora are probably two of the worst places to go. Use a reputable commentary or academic source.</li>
