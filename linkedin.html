            Linkedin is only maybe really useful for submitting a resume for a job if it is something that God has called us to do.
            Otherwise, it leads to a focus on worldly success and achievement that gets us back to where we started - a much worse
            and spiritually unhealthy place than now where we deny ourselves to follow Christ. Connecting with friends on Linkedin
            to build a network is a seemingly cool idea, but the drawbacks are not worth it, and phone numbers and email addresses should suffice.
