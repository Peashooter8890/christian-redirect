        <h1>Are You Hungry and Deciding What to Eat?</h1>
        <p class="message">
            First off, eat when you are actually hungry so that we may actually feel gratitude to God for his gift of our daily bread.
            <br><br>
            Now, as for what to eat - the four main categories can be eating at home, eating out with my brother, ordering uber eats, and eating out with friends.<br>
            Consider and apply the following algorithm with honesty to determine the best choice of eating:
        </p>
        <ol style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Eating out with friends for either active engagement in the thought of evangelism or fellowship with churchgoers? Go ahead.</li><br>
            <li>Eating out with my brother? Make sure you have a decent amount of things to talk about - preferably a Christian topic. If not, no.</li><br>
            <li>Not enough rememberance of God? Do some fasting.</li><br>
            <li>Is it dinner and there is nutritious enough food at home? Eat at home.</li><br>
            <li>Is it lunch and there is nutritious enough food at home? Eat at home.</li><br>
            <li>Order uber eats.</li>
        </ol>
