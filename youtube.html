            Youtube is... interesting. It has sermons and good Christian videos. However, on the other hand, it can be a place that leads to temptations of lust,
            idleness, and worldly distractions. If you want to listen to music, go to youtube music. If you want to watch sermons, there are plenty of websites that help with that.
            For educational videos that are required, we might be able to make an exception, but this should be done sparingly and with caution.
